    // How to write tests 
    // Tests are rust functions that verify that the non-test code
    // is functioning in the expected manner. The bodies of test functions
    // typically perform these three actions:
    // 1. Set up any needed data or state.
    // 2. Run the code you want to test.
    // 3. Assert the result are what you expect.
    //    - the test attribute
    //    - a few macros
    //    - and the should_panic attribute
    // a. add #[test] attribute above the fn test() {};
    // b. $ cargo test => builds a test runner binary that runs the annotated #[test] functions.
    // c. reports pass or fail for each defined test.
